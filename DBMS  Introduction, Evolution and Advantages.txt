                DBMS allows users the following tasks:

Data Definition:
               It helps in creation, modification, and removal of definitions that define
          the organization of data in the database.

Data Updation: It helps in insertion, modification and deletion of the actual data in the database.

Data Retrieval: It helps in retrieval of data from the database which can be 
               used by applications for various purposes.

User Administration: It helps in registering and monitoring users, 
                     enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with 
                   concurrency control and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.

The history of DBMS evolved in three primary phases:
File-based System

Relational DBMS
